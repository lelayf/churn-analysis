# Maca data scientist screener 

Welcome to the take home technical screener! We want to see how you work in a real-world  environment, rather than your ability to solve obscure algorithms. You have 3 days to complete the exercise. Once this is done, weâ€™ll schedule a follow up session to pair on the application and talk through your work.

## Prompt: 
Using the customer churn data in this repo, please analyze and answer the following: 
 * How did you approach cleaning the data?
 * What are the strongest indicators of what would cause a customer to churn? 
 * What could a company do to reduce churn given this data? 
 * If you had to retain customers, who would you prioritize to spend money on? 

Provide a README of:
 * A reasonable decision log of what you think is important. We like to see thoughtful work.
 * Approximately how long did it take to build this solution

Please feel free to reach out with questions! We would rather spend a few minutes making sure you have a clear understanding of the problem set rather losing hours on a project that doesn't make sense
